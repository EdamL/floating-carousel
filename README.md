# Floating Carousel jQuery plugin

<p>Current version: 3.0</p>
<p>The Floating Carousel plugin creates a carousel whose content scrolls according to the position of the mouse cursor over the carousel element, rather than relying on buttons to scroll the content. Moving the cursor further to the left causes the content to scroll faster to the right and vice versa, or up and down for the horizontally scrolling version.</p>
